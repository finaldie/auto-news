# Auto-News: An Automatic News Aggregator with LLM
A personal news aggregator to pull information from multi-sources + LLM (ChatGPT) to help us read efficiently with less noise, the sources including Tweets, RSS, YouTube and Articles.

## Why need it?
In the world of this information explosion, we live with noise every day, it becomes even worse after the generative AI was born. Time is a precious resource for each of us, How to use our time more efficiently? It becomes more challenging than ever. Think about how much time we spent on pulling/searching/filtering content from different sources, how many times we put the article/paper or long video as a side tab, but never got a chance to look at, and how much effort to organize the information we have read. We need a better way to get rid of the noises, focus on reading the information efficiently based on our interests, and stay on track with the goals we defined.

See this [Blog post](https://finaldie.com/blog/auto-news-an-automated-news-aggregator-with-llm/) for more details.

## Goals
The Auto-News was born for the following goals:
- Automatically pull feed sources, including RSS and Tweets.
- Support clip content from source directly, later generate summary and translation (nice to have), including random web articles, YouTube videos
- Filter content based on personal interests and remove noises
- A unified/central reading experience (e.g. RSS reader)
- Weekly/Monthly top-k aggregations (nice to have)
